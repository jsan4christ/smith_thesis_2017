```{r save_rdata, include=FALSE}
#in_vitro_experiments<-read.csv(paste0("~/Dropbox (IGS)/Jacques_Steve_Shared/Manuscript/miRNA/Working/R_script_input/","In_vitro_Experiments.csv")) ## Unstable location- move to preparepipline dir
## Note that previous to OCT26 2017, in_vitro_experiments had only 1 time point (13h) which was used in the thesis. Now it contains time points more aligned with qPCR.
## This was also included in the Smith_Thesis.Rmd file, but moved to Prepare_EdU_Scratch to be more in line with qPCR prep data.

## In vitro experiments is a csv file created manually by compiling the EdU percentages from Cell Prolifer output or scratch area filled from scrach assay data. 

##FIXME
## See XXXX for more information on Cellprofiler and scratch assay. 

in_vitro_experiments<-read.csv(paste0(root_directory,"In_vitro_Experiments.csv")) ## pre-compiled csv datatable. 


save(in_vitro_experiments,file=paste0(R_script_input_directory,"In_Vitro_Experiments.Rdata"))
